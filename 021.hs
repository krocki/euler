-- Amicable numbers  
--
-- Problem 21  
-- 
-- Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper
-- divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n). If d(a) = b
-- and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a
-- and b are called amicable numbers.

-- For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44,
-- 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4,
-- 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

-- Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

d n = sum (divisors n)

-- TODO: can improve this by changing inner loop to y <- [x..10000] and adding
