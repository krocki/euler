-- Coded triangle numbers
-- Problem 42

-- The nth term of the sequence of triangle
-- numbers is given by, tn = Â½n(n+1); so the first
-- ten triangle numbers are:

-- 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

-- By converting each letter in a word to a number
-- corresponding to its alphabetical position and
-- adding these values we form a word value. For
-- example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25
-- = 55 = t10. If the word value is a triangle
-- number then we shall call the word a triangle
-- word.

-- Using words.txt (right click and 'Save
-- Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing
-- nearly two-thousand common English words, how
-- many are triangle words?
