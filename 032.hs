-- Pandigital products
-- Problem 32 
-- 
-- We shall say that an n-digit number is
-- pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for
-- example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

-- The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing
-- multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

-- Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity
-- can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

-- HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only
-- include it once in your sum.

                        z = splitAt a (fst y)
