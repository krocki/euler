-- Names scores
-- Problem 22

-- Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'),
-- a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names,
-- begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. 
-- Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, 
-- multiply this value by its alphabetical position
-- in the list to obtain a name score.

-- For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order,
-- COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53,
-- is the 938th name in the list. So,
-- COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

-- What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
